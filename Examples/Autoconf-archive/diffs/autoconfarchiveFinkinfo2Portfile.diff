-Package: autoconf-archive
-Version: 2012.04.07
-Revision: 1
-Description: Freely re-usable Autoconf macros
-DescDetail: <<
-	The GNU Autoconf Archive is a collection of more than 450 macros for
-	GNU Autoconf that have been contributed as free software by friendly
-	supporters of the cause from all over the Internet. Every single one of
-	those macros can be re-used without imposing any restrictions
-	whatsoever on the licensing of the generated configure script. In
-	particular, it is possible to use all those macros in configure scripts
-	that are meant for non-free software. This policy is unusual for a Free
-	Software Foundation project. The FSF firmly believes that software
-	ought to be free, and software licenses like the GPL are specifically
-	designed to ensure that derivative work based on free software must be
-	free as well. In case of Autoconf, however, an exception has been made,
-	because Autoconf is at such a pivotal position in the software
-	development tool chain that the benefits from having this tool
-	available as widely as possible outweigh the disadvantage that some
-	authors may choose to use it, too, for proprietary software.
-<<
-DescUsage: <<
-	We don't depend on any autoconf or automake packages, but obviously
-	any package using this will need to do so to do anything useful with it.

+description         A collection of over 500 reusable Autoconf macros
+long_description    The Autoconf Macro Archive aims to provide a collection of reusable Autoconf \
+    macros as free software. The archive currently features more than 500 macros \
+    which perform portability tests ranging from compiler support for weird language \
+    extensions to automatic generation of sophisticated Automake rules. All these \
+    macros have been contributed by friendly supporters of the cause from all over \
+    the Internet - this archive is merely a distribution of other people's efforts.
